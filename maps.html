          <h3>
            On the Verona, WI campus, Epic employs over 10,000 people and in
            over 30 different buildings. As a member of the Computer and
            Techonology Services department, I spend a good portion of my time
            traversing the campus and making deliveries of computer equipment
            for employees. With each building having 150+ offices, navigating
            can be extremely time consuming.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            Epic’s internal website currently has a map system, but it is very
            limited as you can only look up one office at a time. My team does
            deliveries for upwards of 20 people per run, so it was a huge hassle
            to search for each office individually.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            I fully developed an internal tool that allows for input of any
            number of offices, and will ouput a webpage with every room in every
            building highlighted.

          <h2 style="color: #cdcfff">Features and Improvements</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>
            When I first created this tool, it started off as very barebones. It
            would only work by taking input from a seperate internal tool
            webpage, and would display a hardly readable list of map images.
            Here is a timeline of the features and improvements I added.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <div style="margin-left: 40px">
            <h4>Zoom</h4>
            <h3>
              With different employees working on different sized screens, with
              different workflows (full-screen view vs. split-screen), I added a
              slider bar to adjust the zoom level of the maps. This way, you
              could easily zoom in closer on a map, or view multiple maps at a
              time.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Labels</h4>
            <h3>
              Some of the maps were hard to read, and it was hard to tell the
              building and floor level of a map image. I added map labels to
              each map, and I found the geometric center of each room to apply
              room number labels.
            </h3>

            <br />
            <h4>Custom Input</h4>
            <h3>
              Most deliveries were done based off a seperate internal tool, but
              a lot were done based off of seperate office lists. I added a
              feature to allow for custom input based on a user-entered list of
              offices. It also accounted for errors such as misformatting and
              building abbrevations.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Check-Off</h4>
            <h3>
              When delivering to mulitple offices on a floor, it can be hard to
              keep track of which rooms you have already been to. I added a
              check-off feature, such that when you click on an office on the
              map, it will become greyed out. Once all offices on a map image
              are checked, the entire image will become greyed out
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Printer-Friendly Maps</h4>
            <h3>
              Some of my colleagues prefer to leave their laptop behind during
              deliveries, as it takes up too much space. They would try to print
              the page, but it became very difficult to read on paper. I added a
              “Print Maps” button to reformat the webpage in a printable format.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Hover</h4>
            <h3>
              With the interactivity of Maps and the other internal tool, there
              was a lot of clicking back and forth between tabs. To reduce this,
              when a user hovered over an office name on the other tool, a
              thumbnail pop-up image of that room highlighted on a map would
              appear.

        <br />
        <h3>
          This tool has made it drastically easier for my colleagues to make
          deliveries. It also serves as a great visualization tool to quickly
          see what buildings have yet to be delivered to. That being said, there
          are still plenty of improvements that can be made.
        </h3>
        <br />
        <h3>
          I am currently in the process of revamping the logic of the entire
          component in order to reduce load times and account for future
          updates. I am drastically improving the appearance and readability of
          each map image, as I am adding labels to every room, rather than just
          the highlighted ones. I’ll also be using more color and interactivity
          to each room, to make it more in line with the appearance and
          functionality of Epic’s current map system.
